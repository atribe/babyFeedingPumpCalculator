I created this app to help me determine the settings I should enter on my daughter's feeding pump.
The basics:
Enter you child's weight and how long you want the feeding to take and the app will tell you the feeding rate to set in the pump and how much total volume will be delivered.

Where the app shines is when you are transition from continuous drip feeding to more regular meals. Because their stomachs aren't used to big meals it is best to slowly transition to big meals. In the app you can specify how long you want the feeding to take as well as how long they won't be fed at night while they are sleeping. This ensures your child still gets the same amount of food, but in a smaller period of time.
