    <string name="About">How much milk or formula does your baby need to eat each feeding? It depends on how much your baby weighs. This app can take your baby\'s weight and tell you exactly how much pediatricians recommend they eat per feeding.

This app is specially designed to help parents with children using feeding tubes. But it will work with bottle feeding as well. All you need to do is enter your child\'s weight and all other calculations are done for you.

The first use is to calculate the correct feeding amount and rate based on the child\'s weight.
The second purpose is to provide feeding rates over any duration of time so that you can slowly and easily transition the child from continuous feeds to bolus feeding.

If you are bottle feeding the calculations still hold true!</string>
    <string name="HowToUseHeader">How To Use This App:</string>
    <string name="HowToUse">To use this app simply input your child\'s weight and press calculate or move the slider to the duration over which you plan to feed and the correct rate and total amount to be fed will be shown.</string>
